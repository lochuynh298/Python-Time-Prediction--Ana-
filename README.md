## 📌 Background & Overview:

### Objective:

### 📖 What is this project about?

The food delivery time prediction model plays a crucial in the food delivery industry. Delivery time directly impacts customer satisfaction and influences their overall experience.

Using regression algoithms like linear regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost we built the predictive model. It was trained on a subset of the dataset using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness

Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error ( MSE) and R-square(R2) score were used to assess the model's accuracy.

The food delivery time prediction model empowers businesses to optimize their operations and improve the overall delivery experience for their customers


### 👤 Who is this project for?
